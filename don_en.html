<h1>Support the Project</h1>

<p>
This site is a work of preservation and sharing of stories from the past. Your support helps keep these archives alive.
</p>

<p>
Donations are essential to ensure the continuation and quality of our work. Many key resources — including texts accessible only through subscription to the BnF, access to online databases or digitized archives — require regular fees. Added to this are the costs of proofreading and translation, carried out by specialists in Old French and linguistic varieties from former French colonies, whose expertise is essential to faithfully restore historical documents.
</p>

<p>
Donations also allow the purchase or rental of rare or out-of-print books, which are necessary to conduct complete and rigorous research. Thanks to your support, we can continue to preserve, study, and make accessible a literary and historical heritage that is often difficult to reach. Every contribution, even a modest one, strengthens the long-term survival of this work and directly contributes to the sharing of valuable knowledge.
