<h1>🕯️ About Legends of the World of Jeddi</h1>

<p>
Legends of the World of Jeddi is more than an imaginary universe; it is a living world born from passion, creativity, and the desire to build stories together.  
Here, every place, every tale, and every character carries a fragment of soul.
</p>

<p>
The world of Jeddi is constantly evolving, shaped by those who take part in it: writers, dreamers, explorers, world-builders.  
Each person brings their stone, their breath, their light, and from this meeting new legends emerge.
</p>

<p>
Our mission is to build a space where imagination becomes a shared playground.  
A place where creativity is encouraged, where a community gathers around the joy of creating, where sharing ideas and stories brings minds together.
</p>

<p>
Here, creative freedom is essential: anyone can invent, dream, and shape their own path, limited only by their imagination.  
Whether you come to read, write, play, or simply dream, Jeddi opens its doors to you.
</p>

<p>
Here, the boundaries between reality and myth fade ever so slightly…  
And perhaps, along a path or between two pages, you will discover the legend you carry within.
</p>

<p>
🌙 Welcome to Legends of the World of Jeddi — a world to dream, to create, to live.
</p>

<p>
The legends gathered here come from ancient works, fascinating libraries, or forgotten manuscripts.  
We restore them and make them accessible in several languages to offer a space where imagination connects people.
</p>

<p><em>Your words, your story, anything you want here…</em></p>
